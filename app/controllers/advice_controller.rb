  # Advice_controller first checks whether current user has TA privileges or not by implementing action_allowed? method. Secondly it sets the number of advices based on score and sort it in descending order. Then it checks four conditions for the advices.
  # 1. If number of advices is not equal to given advices
  # 2. If the sorted advices is empty
  # 3. If first advice score of sorted advices is NOT equal to max score
  # 4. If last advice score of sorted advices is NOT equal to min score
  # If any of the above condition are True, the edit_advice method calls adjust_advice_size of the QuestionnaireHelper class which adjust the advice sizes accordingly.
  # In the end, save_advice method is called which updates and saves the changes in the advices and displays the success/failure message.
